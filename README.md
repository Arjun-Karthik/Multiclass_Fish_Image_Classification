# üêü Multiclass Fish Image Classification

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

    - Rescale fish images to the [0,1] range.
    - Apply data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flipping) to increase robustness.
    - Load dataset using TensorFlow‚Äôs ImageDataGenerator for efficient processing.

2. Model Training

    - Train a CNN model from scratch.
    - Experiment with five pre-trained models: VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0.
    - Fine-tune pre-trained models on the fish dataset.
    - Save the best-performing model in .h5 or .pkl format.
  
3. Model Evaluation

    - Compare metrics across all models: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
    - Generate confusion matrices.
    - Visualize training history (accuracy & loss) for each model.
  
4. Streamlit Application

    - Upload fish images for real-time prediction.
    - Display predicted fish category.
    - Provide model confidence scores.
  
5. Documentation & Deliverables

    - Well-documented GitHub repository.
    - Comparison report of all models.
    - Trained models (.h5/.pkl).
    - Streamlit app for deployment.
  
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

1. Clone the repo:
   
       https://github.com/Arjun-Karthik/Multiclass_Fish_Image_Classification

2.Install dependencies

       pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Streamlit app

       streamlit run app.py

4. Upload a fish image and get prediction with model confidence.
